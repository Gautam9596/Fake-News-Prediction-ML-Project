# Fake-News-Prediction-ML-Project

The Fake News Detection using Machine Learning project aims to build a robust and efficient system for automatically identifying fake news articles from genuine ones. In the age of information overload, the proliferation of fake news has become a significant concern, impacting public opinion, trust in media, and even critical decision-making processes. This project seeks to mitigate this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to classify news articles as either fake or real.
